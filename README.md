# Thinking-Aloud-Test
In this Project, We have successfully performed the Thinking Aloud (TA) test on the website of Air University with a carefully selected diverse group of test users. After the brief intro of the TA test and initial orientation, the consent form, and background questionnaire were taken from the test users. Then We started the actual TA test on the website of Air University (AU).
